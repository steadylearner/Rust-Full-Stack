# How to be a full stack Rust Developer

Read Rust [API guideline](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/). Test code here and refer to [the Rust blog posts at Steadylearner][Steadylearner Rust Blog Posts].

[If you need or know someone to hire a full stack developer, please contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steady-learner-3151b7164/). I also do freelance.

If you want the similar one for Ethereum, visit [eth-diary](https://github.com/steadylearner/ethdev-diary) repository.

## The reason to use this repository

Everything is simple with examples but it is not easy to make them with Rust.

[Use code here and spare your time.](https:/https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/search/Rust) 

## Crates by Steadylearner

* [born](https://github.com/steadylearner/born) is to help you reduce code duplication in struct and enum. [Refer to the Python FAST API documentation that inspired it.](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#reduce-duplication)

[![born python and rust comparision example](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack/blob/master/unite_rust_and_python_with_born.png)](https://github.com/steadylearner/born)

## The current state of this repository

I will update www.steadylearner.com Rust Rocket website. I knew that there was a problem with a view count update but was ignoring that. I will start after my current freelance work.

I am working [while learning blockchain technologies.](https://github.com/steadylearner/ethdev-diary) There will be less updates than before. 

```console

* Update Steadylearner with [a new Rocket async code](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket) and share some parts of it here.

## CLI

If you want to make some apps, refer to [the official documenation](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html) and [the code snippet](https://github.com/rust-cli/book/tree/master/src/tutorial/testing) used there.

* [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
* [Rust on the command line](https://asquera.de/blog/2018-01-20/getting-started-with-rust-on-the-command-line/), [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap#using-derive-macros) and [the blog post for it](https://kbknapp.dev/rust-cli/)

* [Communicating with machines](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/in-depth/machine-communication.html)
* [Real projects](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/)

## Cargo packages

[Use $du -h ./foldername](https://shapeshed.com/unix-du/) first before you use plugins that delete codes to compare.

* [Use cargo wipe](https://github.com/mihai-dinculescu/cargo-wipe) when you are full of unused Rust projects. [See results here.](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack/tree/master/cargo_wipe_results) You can use [$cargo clean](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-clean.html) for a folder. You can also use [cargo-sweep](https://github.com/holmgr/cargo-sweep).
* [Use cargo ws to manage large projects](https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces) and refer to [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). [Read official documentation for this also.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)

## Error handling

[Read how std error works with official documenation.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html) [Learn how to use cusotm error types.](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/e7.custom_error_types.html)

Then, use [thiserror](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror) to build a web server, library etc. Use [anyhow](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror) with it when necessary.

* [Learn how to use thiserror and anyhow with this blog post](https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/)
* [Test them building a web server](https://blog.logrocket.com/create-an-async-crud-web-service-in-rust-with-warp/)

## How to publish a cargo package

Read [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/the-doc-attribute.html) and [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) documentation for it.

Then, refer to [cargo-publish-example](https://github.com/steadylearner/cargo-publish-example) and its [dev.py](https://github.com/steadylearner/cargo-publish-example/blob/master/dev.py) to help the development process.

When you are ready to publish, read [publishing to crate io](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html) and [the similar one from cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html).

Optionally, you can include [doc-comment](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/doc-comment) to test code exampels in README.md. You can also dynamically create Rust documentation with it.

2. [Python](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack/blob/master/with-python)

## Golang

Refactor a private project and include tests there. Make an open source porject refering to that.

* [How to structure Golang projects.](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) Watch [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL6JBUk6tj0) and read [a blog](https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1) and [another blog](https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/) for that also.
* Include some IPFS, Docker etc relevant projects here and production projects in private repositories.

## Blockchain

* Code a complete real project.

## React

## Resume

You can find easily testable projects at [Resume repository](https://github.com/steadylearner/resume). If you are an employer, contact me and I can show the result with a single command with AWS.

## What you will learn with it

The most of the projects here are relevant to Rust. But, you can find the examples of JavaScript, Python, Golang, Docker etc. Just use what solves your problem.

1. How to use HTML, CSS and Markdown in Rust Frontend
2. How to include NPM packages and JavaScript modules in it
3. How to use Rust [Yew]
4. How to write components and organize the Rust project
5. How to build complete **Full Stack Rust Web Application**
6. How to modulize your Rust project
7. How to deploy it
8. How to write sitemaps and metatags for it

## How to contribute

Make an issue. Update deprecated code. Include your project etc.

## Warning

I do what I want here. **It is a personal repository** to learn and prototype new projects.
