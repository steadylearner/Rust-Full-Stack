## The current state of this repository

The list of what I should code. 

1. Play with Tkinter and Selenium a little bit more.
2. Use private repository for production files instead and make a version control correctly.
3. GUI app for post reader, Freelance Job List manager, Tranlsator, Web scrapers caller, Transaction etc with Python.
3. Make your own crate or contribute to a specific one.

## Contact

Send messages with them if you need an immediate help or want me to hack something.

1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steady-learner-3151b7164/) 
2. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/steadylearner_p)

## The reason to use this repository

1. Rust is fast and strongly typed language with many benefits. 
2. But, it takes long time to compile. You can't be sure your code will satisfy the compiler or not.
3. Therefore, use the examples here as your starting points.

**Everything is simple with examples but it is not easy to make them with Rust.**

## Start

First, clone this repository.

```console
$git clone https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack.git
```

Prepare Rust development environment with [How to install Rust]. Then, use one of these commands.

1. **$./install.sh** in **web** folder and **$./run-local.sh** for a full stack Rust chat app. 
2. **$cd static_files && $cargo run --release** for JavaScript frontend and Rust server side web app.
3. **$cd JSON_Webservice && $./run-local.sh** for YouTube vlog example with JSON Webservice.
4. **$cd yew/rust_blog && $./install.sh && yarn watch:rs** for a Rust blog example.
5. **$cd React_Rust** to test a React app with **Warp**, **Rocket**, **Actix**, Express, Restify, Django, Golang, Vibora etc.
6. **$cd sitemap** if you want to build sitemap automatically with a database.

**star** and **share** it with others if you want more contents.
