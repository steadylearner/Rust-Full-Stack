# Target

Price Broadcasting Stream to compare cryptocurrencies. Refer to them if you want to make some price compraision tables with cryptocurrencies.

1. [With more strict rules for security](https://docs.woorton.com/#tag/Stream)
2. [Better documenation and SDK](https://docs.cryptowat.ch)

## What you need to do

1. Read the API of the company.
2. Find more code examples.
3. Make a prototype with public data.
4. Code again with the real data from the company after you pay for it.
5. Make it mobile friendly if you want.
6. Hide public API key with the proxy server.
7. Deploy it to web if you want and test them work.

## Codesandbox Example

Socket IO and React Hook example without CSS.

[price-comparision-table-codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/price-comprasion-table-sandbox-4hd38)

## Layout of the project

1. Get data from live price stream from any company.
2. Create a websocket proxy server for that with a single route at server side not to show API production key at client.
3. Create a websocket client without API key with HTML and JavaScript.
4. Write CSS to decorate it and write mobile friendly CSS also.
5. Upload it to Steadylearner to show the result or screenshot etc.

## SDK

Stream API is not implemented here but use them to find the services of the company.

## Note

It is stopped by the request of the client. I would use cryptowatch.
